## Documentation
run `pdoc odyssey` inside project root to access project documentation
optionally run `pdoc odyssey --html -o docs` to disable automatic opening of browser

## Development guidelines 
+ use docustrings to document all aspects like classes, functions and global variables(only if necessary).
+ keep abstractions as minimal as possible and try to use autopep8 for formattting.
+ add pending tasks to **TODO** section in README.md file.
+ if there are pending works in codebase write a comment in place saying **"TODO: `task name`"** (note: do not leave space between TODO and colon)
+ check the completed works in **TODO** section 
+ update **requirements** with each new package install only at the time of commit and pushing to repo. 

## TODO
+ [x] creating the blockchain required using the architecture provided in the diagrams file
+ [ ] implementing a fingerprint recognition system
+ [ ] implementing a face recognition system
+ [ ] handle database for storing biometric data
+ [ ] implementing an user interface for the given system
